# Introduction to Table Relations with SQL

Knowing at least the basics of writing SQL is a useful programming skill. The
majority of databases you'll work with as a developer will have more than one
table, and those tables will be connected together in various ways to form table
relationships.

In this section we'll cover:

* The structure of a relational database as tables
* Primary key and foreign keys
* How to associate data tables using a foreign key column
* How to model a "many-to-many" object association
* How a join table is used
* Distinguishing the different types of relationships between data in a database
* Different types of joins

Over the next several lessons we'll discuss having multiple tables in a
database, how to define relationships between different tables, and explain the
different types of table relationships that can exist.
